    "Machine Learning (ML) development brings many new complexities beyond the traditional software development lifecycle. Unlike in traditional software development, ML developers want to try multiple algorithms, tools and parameters to get the best results, and they need to track this information to reproduce work. In addition, developers need to use many distinct systems to productionize models."

    "Developing machine learning applications is complex, and the complexity doesn't necessarity strive from the fact that the theory behind the machine learning is difficult, or the math is difficult or the algorithm which are presented are difficult. Although there is some element of complexity, the machine learning frameworks makes it easier by abstracting away the details and exposing a simple class interface to initialise and train the model. In fact the default paramters gives pretty much a good baseline model to work with."
